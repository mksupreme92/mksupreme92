*Building Foundational Design & Engineering Tools*

Welcome. I build tools that think geometrically — from multidimensional kernels to symbolic design languages.

## 🏗️ Currently Building

- 🜁 [**Project Euclid**](https://github.com/mksupreme92/euclid): A modular geometry kernel that works in arbitrary-dimensional space.
