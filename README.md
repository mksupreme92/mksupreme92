*Building Foundational Design & Engineering Tools*

Welcome. I build tools that think geometrically — from multidimensional kernels to symbolic design languages.

## 🏗️ Currently Building

- 🜁 [**Project Euclid**](https://github.com/mksupreme92/euclid): A modular geometry kernel for arbitrary-dimensional, non-Euclidean space — the brainstem for symbolic AI and Large Geometric Models (LGMs).
- ✒️ **Elementa DSL** (coming soon): A Ruby–OCaml inspired domain-specific language for expressing geometric ideas fluently.
- 🎬 Rust Mesher/Renderer: High-performance visualiztion layer for Euclid.

## ✨ A Vision for the Next Phase of Artificial Intelligence  
**July 30, 2025**

Last night, I gazed up through the sunroof of my RAV4 into a sky undisturbed by clouds. The Big Dipper (Ursa Major) and Little Dipper (Ursa Minor) stood out sharply against the dark — quiet sentinels of a cosmos both infinitely complex and improbably ordered. I was awestruck by the paradox: a universe driven by entropy and chaos, yet structured enough to present a remarkably consistent portrait of starlight night after night.

For the past month, I’ve been deep in the trenches of *Project Euclid* — a geometry kernel I’m developing from first principles. I had the option to rely on existing computer-aided design workflows, or to build my own system from the ground up. Naturally, I chose the latter. But I won’t pretend I didn’t question that decision.

There are already sophisticated geometric design and meshing tools out there. Some are open-source and battle-tested — libraries like CGAL, platforms like OpenCascade. I could’ve used them, and returned quickly to my Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics simulation work without worrying about how to rotate vectors in arbitrary-dimensional, non-Euclidean space. Honestly, up until last night, I would’ve struggled to clearly articulate why I chose the hard path. All I had was a vague intuition that this work was foundational — even if it ended up serving only my own design and engineering needs.

But now, I see it clearly: this work has the potential to transform the world.

At this point, few people doubt the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs). They’ve achieved mainstream adoption and reshaped the way we write, work, and code — and they’ve done so at astonishing speed. Like many, I watch their evolution with a mixture of awe and apprehension. I hope — sincerely — that we are wise and clear-headed enough to wield this technology ethically and responsibly.

But the next phase of AI — the one I envision — is different in both structure and scope.

### The next phase of AI is the development of **Large Geometric Models (LGMs).**

#### Imagine this:

A teenager in West Africa, armed with a Raspberry Pi and internet access, wants to improve water access for his village. He types a simple prompt — in his native language — describing the constraints: limited budget, locally available materials, seasonal drought patterns. Within minutes, an LGM responds with a rendered infrastructure design, a bill of materials, and a step-by-step, animated and printable guide for fabrication and assembly. He tweaks a few parameters — slope, tank size, filter mesh — and the model adapts in real time. Now, he’s ready to present the refined design to local authorities. For the first time, they can see the solution clearly: precision-rendered plans, optimized for cost and feasibility. A worthwhile investment is suddenly obvious.

Meanwhile, an aerospace engineer in France has an idea for a low-density metal foam to reduce aircraft mass. She spends an evening generating micro-structural geometries with varying pore sizes, then simulates their structural properties using Finite Element Analysis. Within hours, she identifies an ideal configuration — balancing strength, weight, and thermal tolerance — and runs a thermal process simulation to estimate fabrication energy costs. By the next day, she has the data to propose her concept to supervisors — a thoroughly engineered, simulation-backed innovation — without ever leaving her desk or derailing her primary responsibilities.

A computer hardware specialist in Japan conceives a revolutionary CPU architecture — one that transcends the constraints of conventional 3D layouts, relying instead on a complex topological structure. Translating this abstraction into a manufacturable design would normally take years of iteration. Instead, he inputs the mathematical framework into an LGM. The model responds with detailed electrical schematics, optimized routing, and a chipset layout engineered for manufacturability. As he reviews the rendered design, new insights emerge — opportunities for refinement that were previously invisible. With a few adjustments, he’s ready to move from concept to prototype.

These aren’t science fiction scenarios. They are entirely achievable — but only if we build the right foundation.

Just as Large Language Models rely on a deep structure of symbolic processing, pattern recognition, and vast linguistic corpora, LGMs will require a new kind of infrastructure:

- A geometry kernel capable of operating in arbitrary dimensionality  
- A formalism that understands metrics, topologies, and physical constraints  
- A symbolic framework that treats form and function as first-class concepts  

That’s what *Project Euclid* is.  
It’s not a clone of existing CAD software. It’s a clean-slate reimagining — a kernel built for the future of design intelligence. One that can reason symbolically about space, transform geometry across dimensions, and serve as the backbone of a new class of AI models that don’t just understand the world's linguistic structure — they **also understand its geometry**.

If we want AI to design infrastructure, invent materials, simulate physical systems, and generate manufacturable prototypes — then we must give it the tools to think geometrically.  
We need to build the geometric counterpart to LLMs.

The world doesn’t just need smarter chatbots.  
It needs design and engineering with **integrity**.

And that starts at the beginning — with foundational geometry.

That’s why I chose the hard path.  
That’s why I developed *Euclid*.
