The Navier-Stokes Equations  
$\frac{\partial (\rho u_{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial[\rho u_{i}u_{j}]}{\partial x_{j}} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} + \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_{j}} + \rho f_{i}$  

$\frac{\partial (\rho e)}{\partial t} + (\rho e+p)\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}} = \frac{\partial(\tau_{ij}u_{j})}{\partial x_{i}} + \rho f_{i}u_{i} + \frac{\partial(\dot{ q_{i}})}{\partial x_{i}} + r$  
Einstein summation convention is used here; when a sub-indice ($i$ or $j$) is twice or more repeated in the same equation, one sums across the n-dimensions. 
In the context of Navier-Stokes in 3 spacial dimensions, terms repeat 3 times, each time representing the corresponding dimension (ie $1,2,3$ ‚û°Ô∏è $x,y,z$).  
Equation 1 is for example a shorthand representation of $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial(\rho u_{1})}{\partial x_{1}}+\frac{\partial(\rho u_{2})}{\partial x_{2}}+ \frac{\partial(\rho u_{3})}{\partial x_{3}}=0$.
Equation $2$ is a superposition of 3 separable equations which could be written in 3-line form: one line equation for each $i$ in each of which one sums the three terms for the $j$ sub-indice.  
$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\overrightarrow{u})=0$  

$\frac{\partial(\rho \overrightarrow{u})}{\partial t} + \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot[\rho\overline{\overline{u\otimes u}}] = -\overrightarrow{\nabla p} + \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot\overline{\overline{\tau}} + \rho\overrightarrow{f}$  

$\frac{\partial(\rho e)}{\partial t} + \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot((\rho e + p)\overrightarrow{u}) = \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot(\overline{\overline{\tau}}\cdot\overrightarrow{u}) + \rho\overrightarrow{f}\overrightarrow{u} + \overrightarrow{\nabla}\cdot(\overrightarrow{\dot{q}})+r $

Here $\otimes$ denotes the tensorial product, forming a tensor from constituent vectors; the double bar denotes a tensor. These three equations ($4,5,6$) are equivalent to ($1,2,3$).
