# 🦅 Joseph Shaw Petersen

I build foundational tools for simulation, geometry, and real-world design.

Currently focused on **[Euclid](https://github.com/mksupreme92/euclid)** — a modern geometry kernel written from first principles.  
Lean, precise, and built to outlast bloated CAD giants.

## 🜁 Project Euclid

**Euclid** is a modular, type-safe geometry kernel written in Haskell, designed to support:
- Arbitrary-dimensional geometry
- Euclidean and non-Euclidean metrics
- Transformation logic via extensible typeclasses
- Rust-based meshing and visualization

It is the backbone for my long-term vision of a flexible, open, and performance-aware design ecosystem.  
Inspired by mathematicians, powered by code, and engineered for clarity.

## 🧠 Physics & Simulation Roots

Before Euclid, I worked on GPU-accelerated multiphysics solvers targeting Apple’s [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) API.

This includes foundational work in:

- 🌀 [Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/nseqs.html)  
- 🔮 [Magneto-Hydrodynamics (MHD)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/magnetohydrodynamics)

I wrote low-level simulation code to solve the **Navier–Stokes equations** in index notation form, accounting for mass, momentum, and energy conservation.

My interest in simulation continues, but now I’m focused on building the **geometry infrastructure** that such solvers will run on.

## 🔧 Tools I Work With

- 🧮 Haskell (for logic and abstraction)
- ⚙️ Rust (for speed, safety, and FFI)
- 🧱 Swift/Metal (for Apple GPU work)
- 📐 Math: linear algebra, differential geometry, tensor calculus

---

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

Build a modern design and simulation stack that:
- Respects foundational mathematics
- Prioritizes utility, clarity, scalability, and user-friendlyness,  
- Able to run everything from low-resource systems (eg. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) to [high performance compute clusters](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/high-performance-computing/)    
- Doesn't sell out to mediocrity

Let’s leave the world better engineered than we found it.
